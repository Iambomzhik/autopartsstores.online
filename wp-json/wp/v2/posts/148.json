Each store has an extensive line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and reconditioned hard parts, maintenance items and accessories. <br \/>The first store opened Forrest City, Arkansas on July 4, 1979 as the Auto Shack.  The company changed its name in 1987.<br \/>The company also distributes parts and accessories on its website and on an Apple and Android app.<br \/>They also offer automotive diagnostic and repair software (external growth in 1996).<\/p>\n<p>AutoZone opens an average of 180 stores each year and operates without a franchise (35 openings in the USA in Q3 of the current fiscal year + 8 in Mexico, 205 net openings in 2016).<br \/>In Q3, its 5,889 stores are distributed as follows:<br \/>US: 5381<br \/>Mexico: 499 (implant since 1998)<br \/>Brazil: 9 (since 2012)<br \/>They own the land and walls, which they resell or sublet to other types of businesses when they want to close\/move the store.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"auteur-citation\">AutoZone wrote:<\/h3>\n<p>In 1996, AutoZone launched a commercial program offering credit and delivery to professional technicians.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I admit that I didn&#8217;t really understand what this activity is, it still represents $1 billion in turnover in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>EDIT:<br \/>An article on SeekingAlpha made it clear to me:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"auteur-citation\">SeekingAlpha translated by Google wrote:<\/h3>\n<p>In addition, many stores have a trade sales program that offers trade credit and fast delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealerships, service stations and accounts. of the public sector.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In 2012 AutoZone acquired AutoAnything, an online retailer of specialty automotive products.<\/p>\n<p>Evolution of sales since 1994<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><br \/>Growth slowed sharply as a critical size is reached, but the international market is only at the beginning and the US is still growing slightly.<\/p>\n<p>Gross and Operating Margin (EBIT) constantly increasing since 1993 (Price Power)<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828071_479_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>EPS evolution since 2002 (long live the share buybacks, of course)<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828072_246_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are the financial data of xlsValorisation:<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828072_445_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For the number of securities, I had the choice depending on the data source between, 28.16 (WSJ presentation page), (28.41 FT), 29.0 (AZO Q3 2017), 29.3 (AZO cumulative Q3 2017) and 30 (xlsvaluation 2016 therefore WSJ Income Statement).<\/p>\n<p>This is the problem with companies massively buying back their shares, you never know how many there are!  I took 29.30 for safety (the more the more it&#8217;s dilutive) but I think the fairest would have been 29.0.

I didn&#8217;t have fun digging into the calculation, but as with Nike, we note this difference in method.<\/p>\n<p>It should also be noted that the cash position is still capped at $200 million.  In my opinion, this is a sign that it is well used and invested in profitability between new store openings and share buybacks ($1.2 billion\/year on average over the last 5 years).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the HI Score is perfect with a positive trend:<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828074_61_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For comparables I used 4 lists, Morningstar, Infinancials, and Google.

The highest 20 in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Let me quote a sentence from the book Devenir Rentier by Philippe:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"auteur-citation\">HI wrote:<\/h3>\n<p>Cyclical companies alternate between large and small profits depending on economic cycles.  It is at the top of the cycle that their profits are the highest and the PER the most<br \/>weak ;  and at the bottom of the cycle that their profits are the lowest and therefore the PER the highest.  Thus, for cyclical companies, often the lower the PER, the less time to buy!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Are auto parts retailers as cyclical as car manufacturers?  This is not reflected in AZO&#8217;s figures, even in the long term (since 1990).<br \/>I don&#8217;t really know what to think about it, the current PER of 14 TTM would imply the end of the cycle, but the highest (beginning of the cycle?) was barely 2 years ago. <\/p>\n<p>This PER TTM is mainly linked AMHA the sharp fall in the price since January (-25% the ladle). <\/p>\n<p>Itself is linked to rather good results (in my opinion) but less good overall.  Same at the end of 2016. <br \/>Which made me think of Stock Market Newsletter #141 &#8211; Beware of daily media and financial noise<\/p>\n<p>In short, I decided not to take it into account since my interpretation of this news is more positive than the actors of the &#8220;market&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Comparable multiples<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828075_913_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Normalized data <br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828076_694_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Source<\/p>\n<p>For the EPS xlsValorisation takes the net result N-1 divided by the current number of shares.<br \/>According to the sources I found the following estimates: <br \/>41.7 (cumulative EPS over 36 weeks 2017 \/ 36 weeks * 52 weeks)<br \/>43.2 (market watch)<br \/>44.36 (EPS N-1 +9% since it is this evolution which is observed cumulatively in Q3 = solution adopted)<br \/>45.8 (the Q3 x 4 but the activity seems seasonal so not retained).<\/p>\n<p>At the discretion of each<\/p>\n<p>The turnover is the cumulative 2017 \/ 36 x 52 (method difference from EPS but result more conservative than other methods)<br \/>The EBIT + rate is the cumulative 2017 (lower than the estimate of xlsValorisation) as well as the tax rate and the debt.<\/p>\n<p>The difference between the NOPAT and the Net Income of the presentation is that the NOPAT does not take interest expense into account.<\/p>\n<p>Discount rates<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828076_565_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As usual I prefer historical rates.<br \/>For the beta I used the &#8220;Retail Automotive&#8221; industry, because the beta of the &#8220;Auto Loans&#8221; industry seemed to me very high (1.37) compared to that of the company.<br \/>I took the highest between Damodaran and that of the company.<br \/>I could have taken Auto Parts and let xlsValorisation take the average of the two models, we would have a beta of 0.99, which is more favorable than my estimate.<\/p>\n<p>Growth in operating income<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828076_992_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Who gives us the valuation<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"postimg\" src=\"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1654828077_766_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The valuation reveals a high uncertainty (in other words the beta is greater than 1).<br \/>Damodaran&#8217;s beta is based on the company&#8217;s industry and debt burden, but given the company&#8217;s historical beta, this uncertainty is AMHA&#8217;s perspective.<br \/>If we use the average of the 2 betas (as does xlsValorisation d&#8217;origine) with the beta of the Auto Parts industry, i.e. an average of 0.99, the uncertainty becomes normal and the recommended price to buy is only -7% compared to yesterday, the intrinsic value ($705) estimates a safety margin of 16% and an upside objective of 27%.<\/p>\n<p>I have briefly valued (by historical multiples + comparables + normalized data estimated by xlsValorisation): <br \/>OReilly $214 for a $234 course despite a 52 week low!
