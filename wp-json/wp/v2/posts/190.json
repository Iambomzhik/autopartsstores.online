This sector as a whole generated more than 19 billion euros in franchising in 2016, i.e. <strong>more than a third of the total turnover generated by the franchise in France.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What networks are there?  Mainly the various formats linked to large-scale food distribution (hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores), but also bakeries, chocolate makers, specialist organic stores, and more marginally, delicatessens, ice cream parlors, single-product specialists such as wine, ham, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And in terms of profitability?  If the turnover achievable after two years compared to the overall investment already gives a first indication of the profitability of a concept, it would not be enough.  Indeed, between the realizable turnover and the profit, <strong>there is a margin that can fluctuate widely depending on the concept.<\/strong> Clearly, depending on the products sold, the margins can be minimal or significant.  As in all things, when the margins are tight, as is the case in mass distribution, the chosen concept must bet on large volumes, and when the margins are comfortable, as is the case in delicatessens, the chosen concept must focus on quality and advice.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to the gross margins, the franchisee must also take into account in his profitability calculation the costs necessary for the smooth running of his business.  These costs are mainly <strong>staff and site location.<\/strong> Added to this are the royalties claimed by the franchisor, more or less high depending on the concept.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, we must not forget, in the calculation of profitability, to take into account the valuation of the goodwill.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hyper, super, and convenience stores<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the city center or in the countryside, on the outskirts of major cities, large food retailers show real profitability, whatever the format.  Admittedly, in recent years the price battle has somewhat eroded margins, but overall, franchisees who have chosen to open <strong>a small, medium or large food surface<\/strong> don&#8217;t regret it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this sector, several well-known large brands, belonging to equally well-known large groups, share the market.  What are they ?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carrefour Convenience in the first place with its growing list of brands (Carrefour Contact, Carrefour City, Carrefour Express, Carrefour Montagne, Carrefour Bio, Carrefour Bon App, 8 \u00e0 Huit and Proxi) and its 4,000 locations (revenue achievable after 2 years of 900,000 to 10M\u20ac depending on the brand).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to this large group, there is also another multi-brand group, the Casino group with the Casino Supermarkets and hypermarkets concepts (500 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 5 to 15 M\u20ac), Casino Shop (300 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 700,000 to 3M\u20ac), Vival by Casino (1,700 locations) and Spar \/ Spar Supermarket (850 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years 2.5M\u20ac).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Auchan is also developing as a franchise with its concept of convenience supermarkets Simply Market (60 locations), not forgetting the original Belgian network Coccinelle Coccimarket (60 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years from 400,000 to 1.8 M\u20ac).<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bakeries<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In franchises, the bakery concepts (artisanal or cooking terminals) are also showing good profitability, largely supported by <strong>an ever-widening range of products on the shelves <\/strong>(classic breads, special breads, pastries, pastries, sandwiches, quiches, drinks&#8230;).  Depending on the concept, the entry ticket varies between 160 and 600,000\u20ac.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most extensive networks are in particular that of Banette (2,500 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 300,000 to 1 M\u20ac), followed by far by La Mie C\u00e2line (225 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years 700,000\u20ac), Ange Boulangerie (87 locations, achievable turnover after 2 years \u20ac1.2M), Les Fromentiers (84 locations, achievable turnover after 2 years \u20ac500,000), Fischer (68 locations, achievable turnover after 2 years from \u20ac420,000 to \u20ac1.1M).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many networks remain on a fairly modest network, such as Groupe Chevallier (32 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac700,000), La Mie de Pain (25 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac1 million), Histoire de Pains (24 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac700,000), Les Fournils de France (20 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac252,000), or Bor\u00e9a (8 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years from \u20ac550 to 800,000).<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organic stores<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still marginal a few years ago, <strong>organic continues to convince more and more consumers<\/strong>.  The proof of this enthusiasm is tangible: the turnover of organic is indeed increasing by more than 20% per year, and it is not over!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And while a few &#8220;classic&#8221; brands are starting to offer 100% organic concepts to appeal to taste lovers, vegans and vegetarians, most of the growth in the number of points of sale specializing in organic products is based on just a few brands. including Biocoop (400 sites, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac1.57M), Biomonde (192 sites), L&#8217;Eau Vive (50 sites, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac1.6M) or Le Grand Panier Bio (13 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac1.8 million).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These 4 networks are constantly developing due, in particular, to <strong>the excellent margin ratio and the good associated profitability.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">chocolate makers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After several difficult years, chocolate makers are now returning to profitability.  The concepts present go essentially towards<strong> medium to high-end products <\/strong>in formula Belgian chocolates or French chocolates.  Among the most profitable franchise concepts, we find in particular L\u00e9onidas (1,300 locations), De Neuville (155 locations), Les Chocolats Yves Thuri\u00e8s (60 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac170,000), or even L&#8217;Atelier du chocolat (38 settlements).<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">animal feed<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Growing strongly in recent years, animal feed is benefiting from <strong>the enthusiasm of the French for their companions. <\/strong>The sector&#8217;s turnover, which is around 3.5 billion euros per year, is constantly growing.  Among the most profitable networks in this sector, we can cite in particular Husse (114 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac150,000), Pet&#8217;s Planet Zampablu (105 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac140,000) or Kalina (25 establishments, Achievable turnover after 2 years \u20ac150,000).  Note: this specific food sector is distinguished from the others by a fairly low entry ticket (from 5 to 10,000\u20ac) due to the mode of development of brands without shops.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The wine cellars<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inseparable from a good meal, <strong>wine evolves in a buoyant market that is constantly growing.<\/strong> And here again, although the price battle is eroding margins, the fact remains that wine remains associated with pleasure, and pleasure is priceless when the quality is there!  Knowing that wine is a complex product that requires advice, wine cellar concepts are constantly evolving to meet demand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Among the most profitable wine cellar concepts, we can cite in particular Inter caves (125 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 330 to 770,000\u20ac), La Vignery (14 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 1 to 1.8 M \u20ac), Les Caves de Regusse (20 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac145,000) or Vins sur 20 (20 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac400,000).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two recent and very original concepts are also worth the detour: Sweetset (1 location, turnover achievable after 2 years from 200 to 600,000\u20ac) and Winetailors (20 locations).<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Groceries and specialties<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Franchised food offers, in addition to the major sectors described above,<strong> delicatessen and specialty sales concepts<\/strong> such as coffee, ice cream, ham, etc.  Among these various brands, the most profitable are Comtesse du Barry (42 locations), Coffea (50 locations), O&#8217;Sorbet d&#8217;Amour (11 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac300,000) and Yogurt Factory (21 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac350,000), or even new brands such as Gagao (4 locations, achievable turnover after 2 years from \u20ac250 to 400,000), Poivre &#038; Miel (1 location, achievable turnover after 2 years \u20ac550,000) and Xingara: 1 establishment, turnover achievable after 2 years \u20ac900,000).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bakery, super and hyper, chocolate, organic store&#8230; With more than 180 networks and nearly 15,000 franchisees identified in 2016, the franchised food sector is one [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":191,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/190"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=190"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/190\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/191"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=190"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=190"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=190"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
