We&#8217;ve been clearing for ten days and tomorrow we&#8217;ll be returning the keys,&#8221; said Jean-Claude Bourrelier.<\/p>\n<p>With nearly 100,000 euros in monthly losses for several months and the ban on opening on Sundays &#8220;we had no choice, we had to close&#8221;, explained the manager.  He notably denounced the &#8220;unfair competition&#8221; from which this store suffered, due to the installation of a Leroy Merlin nearby &#8220;which, for its part, has the right to open on Sundays&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><b>&#8220;Either all open, or all closed&#8221;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The store&#8217;s 17 employees will be transferred to other stores of the brand.  &#8220;But that&#8217;s as many new positions as we won&#8217;t create,&#8221; argued Mr. Bourrelier.<\/p>\n<p>The leader renewed his call on the government to modify the law on Sunday openings, so that everyone &#8220;is housed in the same boat. Or all open, or all closed&#8221;.  If nothing changes, &#8220;other Bricorama stores could also be condemned to close their doors very soon&#8221;, warned Jean-Claude Bourrelier.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bricorama store in Montigny-Le-Bretonneux (Yvelines), which had been threatened for several months with closure due in particular to the decision forcing it to close [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":143,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/147"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=147"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/147\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/143"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=147"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=147"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/autopartsstores.online\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=147"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
