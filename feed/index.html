										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bakery, super and hyper, chocolate, organic store&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With more than 180 networks and nearly 15,000 franchisees identified in 2016, the franchised food sector is one of the heavyweights of the model.  This sector as a whole generated more than 19 billion euros in franchising in 2016, i.e. <strong>more than a third of the total turnover generated by the franchise in France.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What networks are there?  Mainly the various formats linked to large-scale food distribution (hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores), but also bakeries, chocolate makers, specialist organic stores, and more marginally, delicatessens, ice cream parlors, single-product specialists such as wine, ham, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And in terms of profitability?  If the turnover achievable after two years compared to the overall investment already gives a first indication of the profitability of a concept, it would not be enough.  Indeed, between the realizable turnover and the profit, <strong>there is a margin that can fluctuate widely depending on the concept.</strong> Clearly, depending on the products sold, the margins can be minimal or significant.  As in all things, when the margins are tight, as is the case in mass distribution, the chosen concept must bet on large volumes, and when the margins are comfortable, as is the case in delicatessens, the chosen concept must focus on quality and advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the gross margins, the franchisee must also take into account in his profitability calculation the costs necessary for the smooth running of his business.  These costs are mainly <strong>staff and site location.</strong> Added to this are the royalties claimed by the franchisor, more or less high depending on the concept.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, we must not forget, in the calculation of profitability, to take into account the valuation of the goodwill.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Hyper, super, and convenience stores</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the city center or in the countryside, on the outskirts of major cities, large food retailers show real profitability, whatever the format.  Admittedly, in recent years the price battle has somewhat eroded margins, but overall, franchisees who have chosen to open <strong>a small, medium or large food surface</strong> don&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this sector, several well-known large brands, belonging to equally well-known large groups, share the market.  What are they ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carrefour Convenience in the first place with its growing list of brands (Carrefour Contact, Carrefour City, Carrefour Express, Carrefour Montagne, Carrefour Bio, Carrefour Bon App, 8 à Huit and Proxi) and its 4,000 locations (revenue achievable after 2 years of 900,000 to 10M€ depending on the brand).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this large group, there is also another multi-brand group, the Casino group with the Casino Supermarkets and hypermarkets concepts (500 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 5 to 15 M€), Casino Shop (300 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 700,000 to 3M€), Vival by Casino (1,700 locations) and Spar / Spar Supermarket (850 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years 2.5M€).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Auchan is also developing as a franchise with its concept of convenience supermarkets Simply Market (60 locations), not forgetting the original Belgian network Coccinelle Coccimarket (60 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years from 400,000 to 1.8 M€).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The bakeries</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In franchises, the bakery concepts (artisanal or cooking terminals) are also showing good profitability, largely supported by <strong>an ever-widening range of products on the shelves </strong>(classic breads, special breads, pastries, pastries, sandwiches, quiches, drinks&#8230;).  Depending on the concept, the entry ticket varies between 160 and 600,000€.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most extensive networks are in particular that of Banette (2,500 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 300,000 to 1 M€), followed by far by La Mie Câline (225 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years 700,000€), Ange Boulangerie (87 locations, achievable turnover after 2 years €1.2M), Les Fromentiers (84 locations, achievable turnover after 2 years €500,000), Fischer (68 locations, achievable turnover after 2 years from €420,000 to €1.1M).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many networks remain on a fairly modest network, such as Groupe Chevallier (32 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €700,000), La Mie de Pain (25 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €1 million), Histoire de Pains (24 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €700,000), Les Fournils de France (20 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €252,000), or Boréa (8 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years from €550 to 800,000).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Organic stores</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still marginal a few years ago, <strong>organic continues to convince more and more consumers</strong>.  The proof of this enthusiasm is tangible: the turnover of organic is indeed increasing by more than 20% per year, and it is not over!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And while a few &#8220;classic&#8221; brands are starting to offer 100% organic concepts to appeal to taste lovers, vegans and vegetarians, most of the growth in the number of points of sale specializing in organic products is based on just a few brands. including Biocoop (400 sites, turnover achievable after 2 years €1.57M), Biomonde (192 sites), L&#8217;Eau Vive (50 sites, turnover achievable after 2 years €1.6M) or Le Grand Panier Bio (13 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years €1.8 million).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These 4 networks are constantly developing due, in particular, to <strong>the excellent margin ratio and the good associated profitability.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">chocolate makers</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After several difficult years, chocolate makers are now returning to profitability.  The concepts present go essentially towards<strong> medium to high-end products </strong>in formula Belgian chocolates or French chocolates.  Among the most profitable franchise concepts, we find in particular Léonidas (1,300 locations), De Neuville (155 locations), Les Chocolats Yves Thuriès (60 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €170,000), or even L&#8217;Atelier du chocolat (38 settlements).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">animal feed</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing strongly in recent years, animal feed is benefiting from <strong>the enthusiasm of the French for their companions. </strong>The sector&#8217;s turnover, which is around 3.5 billion euros per year, is constantly growing.  Among the most profitable networks in this sector, we can cite in particular Husse (114 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years €150,000), Pet&#8217;s Planet Zampablu (105 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years €140,000) or Kalina (25 establishments, Achievable turnover after 2 years €150,000).  Note: this specific food sector is distinguished from the others by a fairly low entry ticket (from 5 to 10,000€) due to the mode of development of brands without shops.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The wine cellars</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inseparable from a good meal, <strong>wine evolves in a buoyant market that is constantly growing.</strong> And here again, although the price battle is eroding margins, the fact remains that wine remains associated with pleasure, and pleasure is priceless when the quality is there!  Knowing that wine is a complex product that requires advice, wine cellar concepts are constantly evolving to meet demand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the most profitable wine cellar concepts, we can cite in particular Inter caves (125 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 330 to 770,000€), La Vignery (14 establishments, turnover achievable after 2 years from 1 to 1.8 M €), Les Caves de Regusse (20 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €145,000) or Vins sur 20 (20 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €400,000).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two recent and very original concepts are also worth the detour: Sweetset (1 location, turnover achievable after 2 years from 200 to 600,000€) and Winetailors (20 locations).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Groceries and specialties</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Franchised food offers, in addition to the major sectors described above,<strong> delicatessen and specialty sales concepts</strong> such as coffee, ice cream, ham, etc.  Among these various brands, the most profitable are Comtesse du Barry (42 locations), Coffea (50 locations), O&#8217;Sorbet d&#8217;Amour (11 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €300,000) and Yogurt Factory (21 locations, turnover achievable after 2 years €350,000), or even new brands such as Gagao (4 locations, achievable turnover after 2 years from €250 to 400,000), Poivre &#038; Miel (1 location, achievable turnover after 2 years €550,000) and Xingara: 1 establishment, turnover achievable after 2 years €900,000).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were waiting for the breakthrough of e-commerce in food distribution and it is “d-commerce”, one of these avatars, which is exploding.  D for “drive(s)”, these warehouse stores where you load groceries into the trunk of your car after ordering them on the internet.  They are springing up like mushrooms, usually attached to existing stores.  As an acknowledgment of the failure of the latter to offer their customers fast, practical and pleasant shopping.  But no matter, since you have to be.  They are also flourishing more and more at a distance from their &#8220;mother&#8221; store (back-to-back), even independently (solo).</p>
<p>How many are they ?  Numbers vary.  Between 600 and 750. <i>LSA Atlas</i> there are nearly 700 of them. Nielsen estimates that, since the beginning of the year, about a hundred warehouses have been built, that is to say ten per month.  Leclerc alone says he inaugurates one or two a week and sees himself tomorrow &#8211; in less than ten years &#8211; at the head of a fleet of more than 1,000 warehouses.  1,000 is the symbolic milestone that this new format should reach next year, as the distribution staffs are so enthusiastic about this new format.  Not a press conference or a strategic point without mentioning the question of the development of drives, a format considered to be still marginal only two years ago.</p>
<p>Yes, but since the graft has started to take hold, these new types of sales outlets have found an audience, customers.  More than one million French households (1.15) have chosen to have their coffers filled on the order recovery “tracks”.  Many mothers, people in a hurry, all tired of wasting hours filling their weekly carts.</p>
<p>Forecasters are racing ahead of what must be called a new commercial revolution.  Kurt Salmon estimates the market at 4 billion euros in turnover from 2015, against barely 500 million in 2010, and 350 million in 2009&#8230; An extrapolation by Kantar, revealed by Casino, even figures the share of sales of consumer products that could be monopolized by distance shopping and, mainly, by drive within ten years, against 1% last year.  Essentially at the expense of hypermarkets.</p>
<p>Consultant fantasy?  Nothing is less sure.  On the ground, even if the pioneers Auchan and Chronodrive still do not claim to be profitable, the economic model is furiously similar to the finest hours of modern commerce, when a hypermarket was profitable in a handful of years.  The return on investment of a beautiful back-to-back drive is achieved in just four years, with pre-tax profitability that can reach 5% of turnover, more than twice as much as a hypermarket!  All for a starting bet five to ten times lower than that of a supermarket, and a turnover that can climb up to 10 million euros.</p>
<p>To decipher and understand this new format, the writing of <i>LSA </i>went to investigate in the field, looking at the 10 pillars on which this new model is based.  Everyone drive!</p>
<blockquote class="encadreGauche">
<p class="titreType8"><strong>THE PHENOMENON IN FIGURES</strong>&#13;

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I wanted to share with you my appreciation of AutoZone.</p>
<p>It was thanks to Philippe&#8217;s newsletters that I became interested in AutoZone.<br />NL#119 on companies massively buying back their shares, and NL#215 The most profitable big caps on the planet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.png" /></p>
<p>AutoZone is the leading US distributor ($11 billion turnover) of automotive spare parts and accessories with more than 5,000 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil.  Each store has an extensive line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and reconditioned hard parts, maintenance items and accessories. <br />The first store opened Forrest City, Arkansas on July 4, 1979 as the Auto Shack.  The company changed its name in 1987.<br />The company also distributes parts and accessories on its website and on an Apple and Android app.<br />They also offer automotive diagnostic and repair software (external growth in 1996).</p>
<p>AutoZone opens an average of 180 stores each year and operates without a franchise (35 openings in the USA in Q3 of the current fiscal year + 8 in Mexico, 205 net openings in 2016).<br />In Q3, its 5,889 stores are distributed as follows:<br />US: 5381<br />Mexico: 499 (implant since 1998)<br />Brazil: 9 (since 2012)<br />They own the land and walls, which they resell or sublet to other types of businesses when they want to close/move the store.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 class="auteur-citation">AutoZone wrote:</h3>
<p>In 1996, AutoZone launched a commercial program offering credit and delivery to professional technicians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit that I didn&#8217;t really understand what this activity is, it still represents $1 billion in turnover in 2011.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br />An article on SeekingAlpha made it clear to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 class="auteur-citation">SeekingAlpha translated by Google wrote:</h3>
<p>In addition, many stores have a trade sales program that offers trade credit and fast delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealerships, service stations and accounts. of the public sector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2012 AutoZone acquired AutoAnything, an online retailer of specialty automotive products.</p>
<p>Evolution of sales since 1994<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /><br />Growth slowed sharply as a critical size is reached, but the international market is only at the beginning and the US is still growing slightly.</p>
<p>Gross and Operating Margin (EBIT) constantly increasing since 1993 (Price Power)<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828071_479_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>EPS evolution since 2002 (long live the share buybacks, of course)<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828072_246_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here are the financial data of xlsValorisation:<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828072_445_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>For the number of securities, I had the choice depending on the data source between, 28.16 (WSJ presentation page), (28.41 FT), 29.0 (AZO Q3 2017), 29.3 (AZO cumulative Q3 2017) and 30 (xlsvaluation 2016 therefore WSJ Income Statement).</p>
<p>This is the problem with companies massively buying back their shares, you never know how many there are!  I took 29.30 for safety (the more the more it&#8217;s dilutive) but I think the fairest would have been 29.0.  The spread is small and only affects the valuation by $4.</p>
<p>Superb fundamentals<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828072_176_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>Solvency ratios that seem quite correct to me (net debt 2 times EBITDA (Kellogg&#8217;s is 3.5) and very high coverage of financial charges)<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828073_186_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>Very high payout ratios (too?).  No dividends, only share buybacks, which is great for capitalization and (personal) reinvestment in the business.<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828073_224_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>Does this mean that the company is going into debt to buy back its own shares? <br />I think so, it is a risky practice in the event of a downturn in activity.</p>
<p>However today, given the contained debt AMHJ (2 x EBITDA), the magnitude of the ROIC (greater than 40%) and the average cost of capital below 8% including the low cost of debt (3.1% gross, 2.0% net ) I think it&#8217;s very accretive.</p>
<p>Profitability ratios<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828074_243_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>Gross margin and MOP are consistent between xlsValorisation and AZO&#8217;s presentations.</p>
<p>FCF margins and profit margins are correlated: a sign of the &#8220;reliability&#8221; of the net result.<br />The ROE is negative and ineffective, normal for a company massively buying back its shares.<br />ROIC &#038; CROIC are excellent even if the trend is constrained.<br />Note that AZO estimates its ROIC at around 32%.  I didn&#8217;t have fun digging into the calculation, but as with Nike, we note this difference in method.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the cash position is still capped at $200 million.  In my opinion, this is a sign that it is well used and invested in profitability between new store openings and share buybacks ($1.2 billion/year on average over the last 5 years).</p>
<p>Finally, the HI Score is perfect with a positive trend:<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828074_61_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>For comparables I used 4 lists, Morningstar, Infinancials, and Google.  Become an Annuitant!<br />The selected companies are:<br />O&#8217;Reilly Automotive Inc<br />Advance Auto Parts Inc<br />CarMax Inc<br />Genuine Parts<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828074_928_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>Regarding comparables, pay attention to the suffix NSQ (here ORLY) if you enter it in the green box and then click on the &#8220;change&#8221; button, xlsValorisation will by default correct the suffix to &#8220;NYQ&#8221; (like most US values) and if you are not careful the beta will not be picked up by the tool.</p>
<p>Historical multiples (since 2011, I always exclude the 2007-2010 range although available on Morningstar but potentially biased by the context)<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828075_213_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>A reflection on historical PERs below:<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828075_579_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>The lowest PER was 12.8 in 2009 (financial crisis), otherwise 13.6 in 2007. The highest 20 in 2015.</p>
<p>Let me quote a sentence from the book Devenir Rentier by Philippe:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 class="auteur-citation">HI wrote:</h3>
<p>Cyclical companies alternate between large and small profits depending on economic cycles.  It is at the top of the cycle that their profits are the highest and the PER the most<br />weak ;  and at the bottom of the cycle that their profits are the lowest and therefore the PER the highest.  Thus, for cyclical companies, often the lower the PER, the less time to buy!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are auto parts retailers as cyclical as car manufacturers?  This is not reflected in AZO&#8217;s figures, even in the long term (since 1990).<br />I don&#8217;t really know what to think about it, the current PER of 14 TTM would imply the end of the cycle, but the highest (beginning of the cycle?) was barely 2 years ago. </p>
<p>This PER TTM is mainly linked AMHA the sharp fall in the price since January (-25% the ladle). </p>
<p>Itself is linked to rather good results (in my opinion) but less good overall.  Same at the end of 2016. <br />Which made me think of Stock Market Newsletter #141 &#8211; Beware of daily media and financial noise</p>
<p>In short, I decided not to take it into account since my interpretation of this news is more positive than the actors of the &#8220;market&#8221;.</p>
<p>Comparable multiples<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828075_913_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>Normalized data <br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828076_694_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>Source</p>
<p>For the EPS xlsValorisation takes the net result N-1 divided by the current number of shares.<br />According to the sources I found the following estimates: <br />41.7 (cumulative EPS over 36 weeks 2017 / 36 weeks * 52 weeks)<br />43.2 (market watch)<br />44.36 (EPS N-1 +9% since it is this evolution which is observed cumulatively in Q3 = solution adopted)<br />45.8 (the Q3 x 4 but the activity seems seasonal so not retained).</p>
<p>At the discretion of each</p>
<p>The turnover is the cumulative 2017 / 36 x 52 (method difference from EPS but result more conservative than other methods)<br />The EBIT + rate is the cumulative 2017 (lower than the estimate of xlsValorisation) as well as the tax rate and the debt.</p>
<p>The difference between the NOPAT and the Net Income of the presentation is that the NOPAT does not take interest expense into account.</p>

<p>As usual I prefer historical rates.<br />For the beta I used the &#8220;Retail Automotive&#8221; industry, because the beta of the &#8220;Auto Loans&#8221; industry seemed to me very high (1.37) compared to that of the company.<br />I took the highest between Damodaran and that of the company.<br />I could have taken Auto Parts and let xlsValorisation take the average of the two models, we would have a beta of 0.99, which is more favorable than my estimate.</p>

<p>Who gives us the valuation<br /><img loading="lazy" class="postimg" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828077_766_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.jpg" /></p>
<p>The valuation reveals a high uncertainty (in other words the beta is greater than 1).<br />Damodaran&#8217;s beta is based on the company&#8217;s industry and debt burden, but given the company&#8217;s historical beta, this uncertainty is AMHA&#8217;s perspective.<br />If we use the average of the 2 betas (as does xlsValorisation d&#8217;origine) with the beta of the Auto Parts industry, i.e. an average of 0.99, the uncertainty becomes normal and the recommended price to buy is only -7% compared to yesterday, the intrinsic value ($705) estimates a safety margin of 16% and an upside objective of 27%.</p>
<p>I have briefly valued (by historical multiples + comparables + normalized data estimated by xlsValorisation): <br />OReilly $214 for a $234 course despite a 52 week low!  HI Score 9 positive<br />Advance Auto Parts Inc. $138 for a course $130 IH Score 6.5 negative (given the not extraordinary accounts I don&#8217;t want to dig)<br />CarMax Inc. $6 for a $62 lesson!  IH Score 5.8 stable (= strongly negative FCF, debt 17 times EBITDA and big beta)<br />Genuine Parts $89 for a stable $94 IH Score 6.5 price</p>
<p>AMF: not yet a shareholder but that should change around 3:30 p.m.<br />EDIT: shareholder-owner $603.18! <img loading="lazy" src="https://autopartsstores.online/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1654828077_399_AutoZone-auto-parts-and-accessories.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="fig-paragraph">The Bricorama store in Montigny-Le-Bretonneux (Yvelines), which had been threatened for several months with closure due in particular to the decision forcing it to close on Sundays, has officially closed, said today. now the brand&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, the decision has finally been made. We&#8217;ve been clearing for ten days and tomorrow we&#8217;ll be returning the keys,&#8221; said Jean-Claude Bourrelier.</p>
<p>With nearly 100,000 euros in monthly losses for several months and the ban on opening on Sundays &#8220;we had no choice, we had to close&#8221;, explained the manager.  He notably denounced the &#8220;unfair competition&#8221; from which this store suffered, due to the installation of a Leroy Merlin nearby &#8220;which, for its part, has the right to open on Sundays&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Either all open, or all closed&#8221;</b></p>
<p>The store&#8217;s 17 employees will be transferred to other stores of the brand.  &#8220;But that&#8217;s as many new positions as we won&#8217;t create,&#8221; argued Mr. Bourrelier.</p>
<p>The leader renewed his call on the government to modify the law on Sunday openings, so that everyone &#8220;is housed in the same boat. Or all open, or all closed&#8221;.  If nothing changes, &#8220;other Bricorama stores could also be condemned to close their doors very soon&#8221;, warned Jean-Claude Bourrelier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="fig-paragraph">More DIY stores were able to open their doors today throughout France, as a result of a decree published on Tuesday authorizing establishments in the sector to temporarily derogate from Sunday rest, we learned from concordant sources.</p>
<p>“Thirty-three stores are open”, including 27 in Ile-de-France, or “a small third of French stores”, Jean-Claude Bourrelier, CEO of Bricorama, told AFP.  The company had until then no exemption to open on Sundays, unlike its competitors, which had provoked a legal and political battle.</p>
<p>To give itself time to review the rules deemed too confusing, the government published a decree on December 31 authorizing establishments in the sector to temporarily derogate, until July 1, 2015, from Sunday rest.  Some 178 stores under the Brico Dépôt, Bricomarché, Bricorama-Batkor, Castorama, Leroy-Merlin, Les Briconautes, Mr Bricolage and Weldom brands are affected.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[March 17, 2020 upsa-agvs.ch – The implications for garages in Switzerland of the measures taken by the Confederation in the fight against the coronavirus crisis [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>March 17, 2020 upsa-agvs.ch – The implications for garages in Switzerland of the measures taken by the Confederation in the fight against the coronavirus crisis are now clear: workshops can continue to work, but personal sales in showrooms are suspended .</strong></p>
<p>school  Today, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has regulated in detail the consequences of the measures aimed at shutting down public life for craft businesses in Switzerland.  Radical changes are also taking place for mechanics.  Let&#8217;s start with the good news: workshops can continue to work if they wish.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;comments relating to ordinance 2 of March 13, 2020 on measures intended to combat the coronavirus (ordinance 2 COVID-19), status on March 16, 2020&#8243;*, the FOPH specifies which establishments are not closed during public: automobile and bicycle workshops are among them.</p>
<p>In a second document containing frequently asked questions*, the FOPH writes that craft businesses can continue to work and that they are not subject to the obligation to close.  However, the stores of these companies accessible to the public must be closed.  This means that the showrooms of Swiss garages must be banned from now on and that the sale of vehicles is suspended for the time being.  Whether selling by phone or online is still possible is subject to clarification.</p>
<p>The measures taken by the Confederation with the aim of slowing down the spread of the coronavirus are valid for the moment until April 19.</p>
<p>(* The documents are not yet available in French. We are constantly on the FOPH website and will publish the documents on agvs-upsa.ch as soon as they are available in French translation.<br /> 
</p>
<h2 class="title_h2">The SAD branch solution offers some advice to companies in their relations with customers:</h2>
<ul class="number_list">
<li>The measures of the Confederation, the cantons and the FOPH must imperatively be respected.</li>
<li>The health of customers and employees is the top priority.</li>
<li>Keep calm and ensure that employees have the same information in accordance with the measures recommended by the Confederation, the FOPH and the cantons.</li>
<li>Proactive management of communication on digital channels (e-mail, Skype, Messenger, etc.).</li>
<li>Inform on the website that visits to the car workshop are always possible, restricted or prohibited (depending on the canton!), but that the urgency should be assessed beforehand.  Communication of telephone number and e-mail address for urgent interventions.</li>
<li>Put up a sign at the entrance, give up shaking hands with employees and customers and keep your distance.</li>
<li>Avoid cash payments.</li>
<li>Disinfect steering wheels, door handles, gear levers, touch screens, fuel filler flaps, etc.  before handing over the vehicle.</li>
<li>Use single-use steering wheel covers and disinfect your hands each time you change vehicles.</li>
<li>Have disinfectant and hand cream at the entrance with the corresponding information.</li>
<li>Take into account in the planning the difficulties of delivery for spare parts / vehicles.</li>
<li>Reduce, if necessary, the available capacities of the workshop, because the absence of collaborators is to be expected.</li>
<li>Check the calendar of events.</li>
<li>For any urgent questions, the road traffic offices can also be reached by telephone / e-mail.  In-person visits to offices should be avoided.</li>
<li>License plates and circulation permits can also be sent by post.</li>
<li>After refueling, disinfect your hands, because the pump gun is a real breeding ground for bacteria and viruses!</li>
<li>Important: as a PERCO, assume your responsibilities in the company and actively ensure that the instructions required by the FOPH are implemented.</li>
</ul>
